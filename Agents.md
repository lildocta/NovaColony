# Agents

This project follows the architecture and design decisions documented in [Architecture.md](./Architecture.md).

All agents working on this project should refer to `Architecture.md` for:
- Design System guidelines (Spaceship Control Interface)
- Component standards (ProgramContainer)
- Technical patterns

Upon completion of a task, agents should update the `Architecture.md` file to reflect any new architecture decisions made.
